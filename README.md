This project successfully demonstrated the fundamental process of converting laboratory Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) data, specifically from the differential liberation experiment, into field-ready parameters, addressing Exercise 2.2 from L. P. Dake’s Fundamentals of Reservoir Engineering textbook. The analysis commenced by identifying the optimum surface separation conditions from surface separator tests, which was critical for establishing the necessary correction factors, the Shrinkage Factor ($c_{bf}$) and the Initial Solution Gas-Oil Ratio ($R_{sif}$). Utilizing these factors, the primary field PVT parameters, Oil Formation Volume Factor ($B_o$), Solution Gas-Oil Ratio ($R_s$), and Gas Formation Volume Factor ($B_g$), were calculated as a function of pressure, providing the essential input required for accurate reservoir simulations and hydrocarbon initially in place (HCIIP) calculations. Furthermore, an alternative calculation methodology was applied, converting the conventional laboratory differential parameters ($B_{od}$ and $R_{sd}$) to the field-corrected values, thereby confirming the consistency of the results and ensuring reliable data for production forecasting.
